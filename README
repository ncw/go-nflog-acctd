Go NFLOG accounting
===================

This is a program to do IP accounting using NFLOG.

To use it you'll need to add some NFLOG rules into your iptables (and
ip6tables) and configure go-nflog-acctd to read them.  It will
periodically dump .csv files for you to analyse.

To monitor IPv4 to and from this host you might use

iptables -A OUTPUT -j NFLOG --nflog-group 4 --nflog-range 20 --nflog-threshold 50 --nflog-prefix "IPv4out"
iptables -A INPUT -j NFLOG --nflog-group 5 --nflog-range 20 --nflog-threshold 50 --nflog-prefix "IPv4in"

And to monitor IPv6 to and from this host you might use

ip6tables -A OUTPUT -j NFLOG --nflog-group 6 --nflog-range 40 --nflog-threshold 50 --nflog-prefix "IPv6out"
ip6tables -A INPUT -j NFLOG --nflog-group 7 --nflog-range 40 --nflog-threshold 50 --nflog-prefix "IPv6in"

You then configure go-nflog-acctd using the nflog groups you used in the iptables commands, eg

sudo ./go-nflog-acctd  -interval 1h -ip4-dst-group=4 -ip4-src-group=5 -ip6-dst-group=6 -ip6-src-group=7

Note that go-nflog-acctd needs to run as root.

Build
-----

Make sure you have libnetfilter_log installed.

  sudo apt-get install libnetfilter-log-dev

Then

  go build

Usage
-----

go-nflog-acctd [flags]

Important flags

The NFlog IDs to monitor.  These must match the ones in your iptables rules

  -ip4-dst-group=0: NFLog Group to read IPv4 packets and account the destination address
  -ip4-src-group=0: NFLog Group to read IPv4 packets and account the source address
  -ip6-dst-group=0: NFLog Group to read IPv6 packets and account the destination address
  -ip6-src-group=0: NFLog Group to read IPv6 packets and account the source address

By default IPv4 addresses are not aggregated and IPv6 addresses are
aggregated to /64.  Use -ip4-prefix-length and -ip6-prefix-length to
control this.

  -ip4-prefix-length=32: Size of the IPv4 prefix to account to, default is /32
  -ip6-prefix-length=64: Size of the IPv6 prefix to account to, default is /64

Control where and how often the stats are written

  -log-directory="/var/log/accounting": Directory to write accounting files to.
  -interval=5m0s: Interval to log stats

Misc settings

  -cpus=0: Number of CPUs to use - default 0 is all of them
  -syslog=false: Use Syslog for logging
  -cpuprofile="": Write cpu profile to file
  -debug=false: Print every single packet that arrives

Output format
-------------

The bandwidth logs are written in CSV format to /var/log/accounting by default

They are named by "start of period-end-of-period.csv" eg
"2013-02-11-150000_2013-02-11-160000.csv"

The logs always start with a hearder row then data.  IP addresses can
be IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, either of which can have been masked.

Live Testing
------------

In one window

sudo  ./go-nflog-acctd  -interval 10s -ip4-dst-group=4 -ip4-src-group=5 -ip6-dst-group=6 -ip6-src-group=7 -cpuprofile z.prof

In another window

sudo hping3 127.0.0.2 --syn -p 80 -s 53 --flood

And a third use top to monitor the CPU usage

Check correctness
-----------------

In one window

sudo  ./go-nflog-acctd  -interval 1h -ip4-dst-group=4 -ip4-src-group=5 -ip6-dst-group=6 -ip6-src-group=7

In another

sudo hping3 127.0.0.2 --syn -p 80 -s 53 --flood

Run for a while

Stop the hping3
Stop the go-nflog-acctd

Check to see that the number of packets in the .csv is the same (give
or take 1 or 2) as hping3 printed when it was quitted

Benchmark
---------

Use this to do micro-optimisations on the packet handling code

go test -v -bench .
